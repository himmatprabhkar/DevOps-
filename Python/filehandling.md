      Python has several functions for creating ,reading,writing , appending ,and for deleting files.
      The key function for working with files in python is the open() function.
  
### The Open() function takes two parameters:
   
      1.Filename.
      2.Mode
### The four different methods (modes )for opening a file:
      'r'-Reading a file.
      'a'-Appending a file.
      'w'-writing a file.
      'x'-creating a file.
### In addition we have handling the binary and text mode:
      't'-Text Mode.
      'b'-Binary Mode.
### Syntax for deleting the file created.
      import os
      os.remove("filename")
