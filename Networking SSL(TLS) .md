# Basic Networking Topics:

**This topic is based on Difference between Http & Https & Explaining of SSL(Secure Socket Layer:**

**OSI Layers:**
      Short cut to remember:
      
        All ---------------------- (7) Application.
        
        people ------------------- (6) Presentation.
        
        should ------------------- (5) Session.
        
        try ---------------------- (4) Transport.
        
        new ---------------------- (3) Network.
        
        dominoz ------------------ (2) DataLink.
        
        pizza -------------------- (1) Physical .
        
        
        **Difference between Http & Http(s):**
        
                  Http----Hyper text transfer protocol.
                  Http(s)----Hyper text transfer protocol secure.
                  
                  **Features of HTTP:**
                        * Plain Text format.
                        * Belongs to Layer 7 (Application Layer)
                        * Insecure compared to Http(s).
                        * Port 80 
                        
                   **Features of HTTP(s):**
                         * Encrypted Data.
                         * Belongs to Layer 4 (Transport Layer)
                         * Key Exchange is Possiable.
                         * Its Heavier than the http.
                         * Port 443.
          ** SSL(Secure Socket Layer)**
                   * They are two types of SSL encryption:
                          1. Asymmetric.
                          2. Symetric.
