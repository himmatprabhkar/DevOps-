## Azure Basics for Ci/Cd setup:

**Types in Azure**
```
* Azure Boards
* Azure Repos
* Azure Pipelines
* Azure Test Plans
* Azure Artifacts
```

**Azure DevOps Process of the Ci/Cd**
```
1.Plan
2.Code
3.Build
4.Test
5.Release
6.Deploy
7.Operate
8.Monitor
```
**Plan**
```
This phase involves planning and tracking work items, managing backlog items,
and defining the scope of the project. Azure Boards is commonly used for planning activities.
```
**Code**
```
In this phase, developers write and review code. Azure Repos provides version control services,
such as Git repositories, to manage and store source code.
```
**Build**
```
The build phase involves compiling the source code, running tests, and generating artifacts.
Azure Pipelines is often used to automate the build process.
```
**Test**
```
This phase is dedicated to testing the application. It includes unit tests, integration tests,
and other types of testing. Azure Test Plans can be used for test case management and execution.
```
**Release**
```
The release phase involves deploying the application to various environments (e.g., staging, production).
Azure Pipelines helps automate the release process and manage deployment pipelines.
```
**Deploy**
```
In this phase, the application is deployed to target environments.Azure Pipelines provides deployment capabilities,
and you can use services like Azure App Service, Azure Kubernetes Service, etc., for deploying applications.
